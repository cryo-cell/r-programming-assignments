Create your first basic graphic in R as I outlined in the video and PowerPointDownload power point.

Post the visual on your blog and discuss if your basic visualization in R fits or maybe not fit into Few's and Yau's discussions on how to conduct basic visualization based on simple descriptive analysis.
  
```{r wealth}

countries <- c("Asia", "Europe", "North America", "South America", "Africa", "Oceania")
wealth <- c(0.36, 0.28,0.27, 0.04,0.03,0.02)
pct <- wealth * 100

lbls <- paste(countries, pct)
lbls<- paste(lbls,"%", sep = "")

pie(wealth, labels= lbls,
  main="Global GDP Distribution")
legend("bottomleft", legend=lbls, bty = "n", cex = 0.7, fill= c("white", "cadetblue3", "pink", "darkslategray2", "lavender", "beige"))

```
