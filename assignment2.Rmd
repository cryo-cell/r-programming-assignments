## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Evaluate myMean Function
Use the vector:
```{r}
assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
```
Consider this function:
```{r}
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
}
```
In RStudio, run 
```{r}
myMean(assignment2) 
```
