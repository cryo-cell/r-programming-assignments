## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Evaluate myMean Function
Use the vector:
assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

Consider this function:
```{r}
#assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

#myMean <- function(assignment2) {
#  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
#}

#myMean(assignment2) 
```
and record the output or error.
On both your blog and GitHub repository, post..

-The result or error message from testing myMean:
(Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'assignment' not found)

-An explanation of why the function fails or succeeds (hint: variable names):
Scope Gap: A good function should take an input x, process x, and return a result like a "black box". If your function is looking for a specific name like assignment2 but that variable name isn't defined inside the function's local scope, it will break or produce unpredictable results.

-A corrected version of myMean that correctly returns the mean of assignment2:
```{r}
myMean <- function(x) {
  sum <- sum(x)
  nLength <- length(x)
  
  result <- sum/nLength
  
  return(result)
}

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

myMean(assignment2)
```
